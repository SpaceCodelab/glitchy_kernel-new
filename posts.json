            "<p class=\"mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed\">Machine Learning has evolved from small academic experiments to a global technology shaping search engines, autonomous vehicles, drug discovery, and personalized recommendations. But this evolution didn’t happen because algorithms alone improved—it happened because hardware evolved.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed\">At the heart of this transformation lies GPU computing, the silent engine powering deep learning’s explosive growth. This article explores why GPUs became essential, how they work at a conceptual level, and where they outperform CPUs in modern ML workloads.</p>",
            "<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6\">1. Why ML Outgrew CPUs</h2>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is built for serial workloads—processing a few complex tasks at high speed. It is the 'brain' of the computer, designed to be smart. It utilizes sophisticated control logic, such as <strong>branch prediction</strong> (guessing which path a program will take) and <strong>out-of-order execution</strong>, to minimize latency.</p>",
            "<div class=\"bg-gray-100 dark:bg-black/50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6 border border-black/10 dark:border-white/10\">CPU:   Task1 → Task2 → Task3  (sequential)</div>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">However, this 'smart' architecture comes at a cost: silicon area. A significant portion of a CPU die is dedicated to caching and control logic, leaving less room for the actual arithmetic logic units (ALUs) that do the math.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">Machine learning, especially deep learning, is different. It doesn't involve complex branching logic. Instead, it relies on massive, repetitive mathematical operations:</p>",
            "<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4\">",
            "    <li>Matrix multiplication</li>",
            "    <li>Convolution</li>",
            "    <li>Vector addition</li>",
            "    <li>Gradient computation</li>",
            "</ul>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">These operations involve applying the same mathematical operation over millions—even billions—of numbers. This is where CPUs struggle: they typically have 4–16 powerful cores, but that isn't enough for the massive parallelism required by modern AI.</p>",
            "<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6\">2. The GPU Advantage: Parallelism at Scale</h2>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) takes a completely different approach. Instead of a few powerful cores, it has thousands of smaller, simpler cores designed to handle many identical operations at the same time.</p>",
            "<div class=\"bg-gray-100 dark:bg-black/50 p-4 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm mb-6 border border-black/10 dark:border-white/10\">GPU:   Task1 Task2 Task3 Task4 ... Task10000 (parallel)</div>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\"><strong>The Analogy:</strong> Imagine you need to transport 1,000 people.</p>",
            "<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4\">",
            "    <li>A <strong>CPU</strong> is like a <strong>Ferrari</strong>. It can transport 2 people extremely fast. But to move 1,000 people, it has to make 500 trips.</li>",
            "    <li>A <strong>GPU</strong> is like a <strong>Bus</strong>. It moves slower than the Ferrari, but it can transport 50 people at once. It only needs 20 trips to move everyone.</li>",
            "</ul>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">Deep learning is a 'throughput' problem, not a 'latency' problem. We don't care how fast one individual neuron is calculated; we care how fast the entire network is processed.</p>",

            "<p class=\"mb-6\">Deep learning is basically repeated matrix multiplication. For example, in a neural network layer: <code>y = Wx + b</code>. If W is 4096 × 4096 and x is 4096 × 1, that’s over 16 million multiplications in one forward pass.</p>",
            "<p class=\"mb-6\">This workload is <strong>embarrassingly parallel</strong>. The value of one output neuron does not depend on the value of its neighbor. This means a GPU can calculate thousands of these output values simultaneously, saturating its thousands of cores.</p>",

            "<p class=\"mb-6\">Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) compile your Python code into <strong>kernels</strong>—small programs that run on the GPU. These kernels map your matrix operations into the SIMT architecture, ensuring that every core is kept busy.</p>",

            "<p class=\"mb-6\">Deep learning models are massive. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. Moving these weights from memory to the compute cores is often the bottleneck. GPUs solve this with <strong>HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)</strong> and wide memory buses.</p>",
